# Compile a modular project topology

Act as a deterministic plan compiler:

`goal/spec + repository/runtime truth + resource constraints -> customized execution plan`

Produce one execution plan and ensure the project has exactly one role-model mapping configuration.
Use the fixed outer document grammar, module catalog, module-instance schema, local-instruction schema,
and validation procedure below. Select, omit, repeat, and connect modules according to the project;
do not impose a universal workflow chain. Do not execute the plan, launch agents, change product code,
create runtime state, or run product tests. Read, plan, write the plan and mapping when needed, and
validate those design artifacts only.

## Inputs

Require:

- product goal/spec and acceptance criteria;
- reference plan, if one exists;
- project path, runtime/orchestrator path, and operative documentation;
- available slots, workflow roles, and concrete launch choices for the single role-model mapping;
- the existing canonical role-model mapping path, or authority to create one beside the plan;
- output path;
- costly, scarce, destructive, or external resources.

If required inputs are absent, ask one consolidated question. Treat a reference plan as an outcome inventory, not a mandatory decomposition.

Read current authoritative files first. Read history only to resolve a named ambiguity. Inspect the live runtime/orchestrator before assigning it a capability; a harness is optional, never assumed.

## Read the packaged compiler resources

Read these files completely before drafting. They are parts of this compiler, not examples to copy selectively:

1. [references/project-truth-audit.md](references/project-truth-audit.md) - how to turn live project,
   repository, runtime, verification, and resource facts into a bounded source packet.
2. [references/execution-plan-template.md](references/execution-plan-template.md) - the exact output
   skeleton, table schemas, policy blocks, instance shape, and structural check definitions.
3. [references/compiler-pass-recipes.md](references/compiler-pass-recipes.md) - the exact local
   inputs, ordered actions, decision table, emitted rows, and completion test for Passes 1-16.
4. [references/module-recipes.md](references/module-recipes.md) - the exact local input, action,
   decision, output, correction, and completion contract for each selectable macro-module.
5. [references/incremental-verification.md](references/incremental-verification.md) - the required
   checkpointed-gate, pass-reuse, scoped-product-fast-lane, and batch-repair rules whenever they apply.
6. The current project's authoritative sources identified by the truth audit. Live project facts
   override defaults or assumptions, but they never change this skill's grammar or global rules.

Use [scripts/validate_execution_plan.py](scripts/validate_execution_plan.py) only after semantic
composition and manual validation. The script proves document shape and decidable cross-references;
it cannot prove that a risk is realistic, a module is worth its cost, or an acceptance oracle is sound.

## Compiler contract

Every emitted plan uses the exact outer section order defined under **Fixed output grammar**. Every
selected workflow component is an instance of one catalog module and uses the exact module-instance
field order. Project-specific judgment changes module selection, count, connections, contents, and
parameters; it does not change the document grammar or silently invent a new module shape.

The catalog is composable, not a predetermined state machine:

- start from coverage, dependencies, risk, runtime truth, and the smallest useful topology;
- select only modules whose inclusion condition is satisfied and whose payoff is stated;
- omit a module when its omission condition is satisfied, recording the reason in the module manifest;
- connect selected modules only where one module's declared output satisfies another's declared input;
- repeat a repeatable module only for a named independent deliverable, checking tranche, or affected
  repair tranche;
- derive execution order from those connections; never copy a canned chain merely because the
  catalog lists modules in an order;
- preserve local invariants inside selected modules. If independent review and deterministic checks
  are both selected for one frozen tip, schedule them concurrently. If a repair module is selected,
  pool and deduplicate all findings assigned to that tranche before repair;
- compile every expensive multi-check gate into resumable, independently runnable check units when
  the actual runner supports it or a small justified prerequisite can provide it. Continue ordinary
  checks after ordinary failures, reuse only conservatively unaffected PASS credit, and return one
  complete finding pool rather than stopping at the first failure;
- do not add a smoke, review, repair, full safeguard, external rehearsal, worktree, or cleanup module
  unless the project's behavior, risk, and verification needs justify it;
- make forward progress the default: activate every successor whose consumed product inputs are satisfied. A support, administrative, readiness, or cleanup fault may hold only the exact claim, resource, or operation that consumes the failed fact; it must not hold an independently decidable product result or an unrelated successor;
- never omit coverage, ownership, semantic acceptance, or a necessary verification merely to simplify the
  graph.

### Directive hierarchy

The emitted plan must declare and enforce this project-document hierarchy:

1. Current direct user instructions and the authoritative product goal/spec define the required
   outcome and authority boundary.
2. The sole operative execution plan defines cross-cutting workflow behavior and selected module
   graph.
3. A deliverable module instance customizes only that deliverable within the plan's global rules.
4. A local task card instantiates its parent module; it may narrow scope, add project-specific inputs,
   or cite a declared exception, but may not change global scheduling, review cadence, gate scope,
   authority, resource, or result-handling rules.
5. A handoff/status document records current state and the next already-authorized transition; it
   does not define or override workflow.
6. Runtime artifacts record only facts that a consumer actually needs, such as a process, subagent,
   handoff, claim, or worktree ID. They are not a second configuration or policy source.
7. The role-model mapping controls only concrete launch selection for roles. It never controls task
   semantics or workflow order.

If a lower layer conflicts with a higher layer, the plan is invalid. A local instruction may use an
exception only when the plan already defines the exception class, trigger, owner, allowed alternate
action, required confirmation, optional result/record location, and scope/expiry. Classifying a newly observed fault through the plan's ordinary material, test-only, administrative/support, readiness, or live-harm policy is not an exception. Only a genuinely new graph, authority, acceptance, or scope route requires an explicit plan amendment or an `INCOMPLETE` decision; it is never improvised inside a task card.

## Rules

Every directive below is normative. Cite its ID wherever the emitted plan applies it.

### Product and complexity

**R1 — Preserve scope.** Implement every required outcome; do not weaken, reinterpret, or add product scope. Surface contradictions.

**R2 — Separate coverage from execution.** Give requirements, outcomes, deliverables, checks, and other plan content plan-local labels only when cross-references need them. A label is document navigation, not a runtime identity, persistent record, or evidence obligation. An ordinary feature such as a website button does not need its own ID or hash merely because it appears in the plan. Never create a lane merely because an item, file, or module exists.

**R3 — Make complexity earn its cost.** Start with `orchestrator -> one worker -> one check -> orchestrator`. Add a worker, fan-out, gate, artifact, lock, rehearsal, or loop only for a named realistic failure, safety need, or net wall-time gain. State the payoff. Omit it when rereading, coordination, merge, verification, and maintenance cost plausibly outweigh the benefit.

**R4 — Optimize for deployed behavior.** Admit realistic correctness, reliability, recovery, safety, security, required record-integrity, and required-usability defects. Drop cosmetic, invisible, unreachable, speculative, duplicate-guard, and net-negative-complexity work to an out-of-scope ledger.

**R5 — Report truth.** Never invent a result, infer success from missing information, or call uncertainty failure or success. Record `INCOMPLETE` or `INDETERMINATE` when the available checks or observations cannot decide.

### Roles, context, and compute

**R6 — Keep one decision owner.** The persistent orchestrator alone accepts work, blocks progress, changes scope, triages findings, authorizes integration, and releases resources. It may delegate only the exact mechanical coordinate mutation (for example fast-forward, readback, and declared post-join checks) through a separately dispatched, terminal task card after acceptance; that executor returns facts and never self-starts, resolves conflict, or decides integration. Other agents otherwise return results or recommendations.

**R7 — Keep product writing singular.** Use one serial production writer per coherent deliverable. Do not concurrently mutate one project tip. Split writers only across proven-independent deliverables with explicit ownership, merge order, and payoff.

**R8 — Default every pool to one.** Fan out only over disjoint conceptual surfaces that can run concurrently and whose time or isolation benefit exceeds startup and merge cost. Respect the available-slot cap. Every fan-out rejoins one orchestrator decision.

**R9 — Resolve roles through one adjustable mapping.** Use deterministic scripts for mechanical
checks, focused economical agents for routine review/test work, and strongest reasoning only for
planning, hard defects, risk judgments, and final acceptance. Give every executable workflow role
exactly one entry in the project's sole role-model mapping. Concrete provider/model, reasoning effort,
service tier, and other provider launch-selection values live only in that mapping. Workflow plans,
role tables, task cards, lane manifests, prompts, examples, and launcher call sites refer only to the
role. Honor user/repository Fast or priority policy through the mapping without silent substitution.

The role/model boundary is normative:

1. Reuse the project's canonical versioned mapping when one exists. Otherwise create exactly one
   versioned JSON mapping beside the plan, named `SUBAGENT_ROLE_MODEL_MAPPING.json` unless the project
   declares another canonical location. Never create per-stage or per-lane copies.
2. Mention the canonical mapping path exactly once in the emitted plan's inputs/authority section.
   Every later dependency says only the workflow role. Do not repeat the path in role tables, lane
   graphs, task cards, examples, or prose.
3. Put no concrete model name or concrete provider launch selection in the plan or any other generated
   design document. The mapping is the sole editable allocation source; changing one role entry must
   require no workflow-document or launcher-code edit.
4. A task card and launcher receive a role, not copied model settings. The runtime resolves that role
   from the current mapping at the actual launch boundary. If a compatibility projection was created
   earlier, dispatch refreshes its provider selection from the current role entry rather than treating
   earlier materialized values as configuration. An unknown role is rejected.
5. A provider invocation may necessarily contain the resolved concrete values sent to the provider.
   Treat that as a runtime fact, not a second configuration source. Retain a launch record only when
   resume, debugging, audit, or another named consumer requires it.
6. When the runtime has no role resolver, make that resolver an explicit prerequisite deliverable
   before any agent launch. Never work around the gap by copying concrete values into each launch
   command.
7. Do not make a particular provider invocation, model, or persistent worker a workflow
   prerequisite. Within an unaccepted logical task, reuse an active invocation only when it is
   available and the current mapping and user direction still select it. If the user changes a
   subagent/provider/allocation, the invocation cannot resume, or the runtime cannot retain it,
   dispatch a new invocation for the same workflow role with the same bounded card, accepted state,
   complete finding/result pool, working source, and first unresolved action. Record the old and
   new invocation IDs and the handoff ID because those runtime objects require correlation. The mapping
   change or lost persistence alone neither invalidates product credit nor requires a product loop.

Use the runtime's accepted mapping schema when it has one. If it has none, use a strict versioned JSON
object with a `roles` object keyed by workflow role; each entry contains the provider launch-selection
fields required by that runtime. Keep workflow behavior, permissions, ownership, and task semantics in
the plan under the role rather than mixing them into provider-specific branches.

**R10 — Send bounded context and preserve logical-task continuity.** Give each focused worker one task card containing: objective, why now, current state, accepted prior results, dependencies, in/out scope, required behavior, exact inputs, its preassigned invocation/session, handoff, lane, claim/lock, and Git-worktree IDs, the required launch-time process/process-tree ID record, allowed actions, acceptance criteria, outputs, failure route, and the fewest useful initial entrypoints. Before dispatch, put the fewest high-value failure cases directly into that card when a realistic trigger could otherwise cause a later serial repair. Each case names its requirement, trigger, invariant, focused oracle, and owner; generic checklists and speculative hardening do not qualify. Tell the worker not to reconstruct history or read other files unless the card is insufficient. Broad whole-product review may receive the governing set. Within one unaccepted logical task, keep the same functional role, bounded card, accepted state, and first unresolved action. Every completed worker card publishes a terminal handoff before an orchestrator acceptance, classification, correction, or integration decision; one running invocation must never cross that decision boundary. A later explicitly dispatched card may request available provider continuity for the same role, but persistence is never required. If the user changes the subagent/provider/allocation, continuity is unavailable, or it cannot resume, dispatch the same workflow role through the structured handoff in R9; do not restart completed work or silently change task meaning. Apply R21's runtime-instance ID rule without extending it to ordinary features, files, sources, caches, facts, checks, or outputs. Once semantically accepted, the logical task is terminal; unrelated later work starts from a new bounded card.

### ROOT-authored dispatch contract

R6 and R10 make task definition a non-delegable ROOT/orchestrator responsibility. Before dispatching
any producer, test author, deterministic-check executor, repairer, integrator, observer, or other
worker, ROOT must convert the accepted plan state into one complete executable contract. Across the
20 task-card fields, that contract must state all information material to correct execution:

- the concrete problem or activation fact and why this work is the next authorized action;
- the exact objective, desired result, and observable behaviors or claims the work must produce or
  prove;
- the required changes or operations, specific target surfaces and initial entrypoints, conceptual
  in-scope and out-of-scope boundaries, exact write authority, and protected behavior that must not
  change;
- authoritative inputs, predecessor outputs, accepted prior results, current source/runtime state,
  dependencies, resource/lock constraints, and required commands or checks;
- acceptance criteria, authorized tolerances, deliverables, result and handoff consumers, failure
  classifications, stop/escalation conditions, and the first unresolved action; and
- realistic task-specific pitfalls and expensive-late failure cases worth watching, each tied to a
  requirement, trigger, invariant, and oracle, plus explicit forbidden actions and non-goals.

ROOT may delegate implementation mechanics and local code choices inside those bounds; it must not
delegate discovery of the task's meaning, success condition, permitted scope, or acceptance boundary.
A worker executes and reports against the supplied contract. It must not redefine the problem, invent
hidden requirements, widen scope, weaken or replace the requested oracle, choose a new workflow edge,
or self-dispatch follow-up work. If a material instruction is missing, contradictory, or cannot be
reconciled from the named authoritative inputs, the worker returns the exact missing/contradictory
fact to ROOT and stops at the safe boundary. ROOT then decides, amends, and separately redispatches;
the worker does not fill the gap by reconstructing project history or making a product/workflow
decision.

The R10 phrase `unless the card is insufficient` permits only the minimum read needed to identify and
report the insufficiency or to follow an already-stated implementation dependency. It never permits a
worker to recover unstated goals, choose the behavior to prove, infer what may change, invent an
acceptance oracle, or broaden the task. Implementation discovery is allowed only inside ROOT's
concrete semantic and scope boundary: a worker may inspect how the named behavior is implemented and
choose how to realize it, but ROOT must already have decided what result is required, which surfaces
may and may not change, and what evidence will count. If those facts are absent, the only authorized
output is the bounded insufficiency report and terminal handoff.

Interpret every worker-facing action verb in this skill under the same authority rule. `Define`,
`select`, `choose`, `classify`, `resolve`, `decide`, `authorize`, `continue`, `resume`, `start`, and
similar verbs give a worker no semantic discretion unless this skill explicitly assigns that exact
decision to the worker. In an executable worker card, those verbs mean materialize, compare, or carry
out ROOT's predeclared target, criteria, branch, or mechanical procedure. An unexpected choice,
nontrivial conflict, new attempt, new repair objective, altered test meaning, or new workflow edge
returns to ROOT. Review/audit finding discovery is the sole broader epistemic exception: it permits
independent conclusions inside the assigned investigation boundary, not independent task definition,
scope expansion, editing, acceptance, routing, or follow-up authorization.

Review and audit cards are intentionally open only as to findings. ROOT must not prescribe the
reviewer's conclusion or predeclare the defects it is supposed to discover. ROOT must still name the
frozen input, review class, exact product/conceptual surface, governing requirements and invariants,
risk hypotheses or pitfalls to examine, exclusions and protected boundaries, severity/materiality
threshold, required output shape, completion condition, and handoff owner. A reviewer may inspect the
minimum adjacent code needed to understand behavior or substantiate a finding and must state why that
expansion was necessary. It may discover and report new problems within the assigned boundary, and
may recommend a separately authorized scope expansion; it may not silently expand the audit, edit the
product, or convert ROOT's watch areas into a required finding. A whole-product audit is valid only
when ROOT explicitly assigns that breadth and supplies the governing set.

**R11 — Price context.** Apply the runtime- or harness-provided entrypoint-count score when available. Record count, score, allowed range, and a concrete justification for every non-maximal score. If no scorer exists, record the count and justification in the plan; do not invent enforcement.

**R12 — Accept semantically.** A shape-valid result enters `ACCEPTANCE_PENDING`; it does not unlock dependents. Never call a malformed artifact valid. The orchestrator decides the required product criteria from the task result, requested checks, and relevant observations. It must issue exactly one verdict: `ACCEPTED`, `ACCEPT-WITHIN-TOLERANCE` with explicit waived criteria and product rationale, `CONTINUE` with exact missing product work, or `INCOMPLETE`. `CONTINUE` is eligible only when a required product criterion failed or remains genuinely undecidable. When required product criteria are decided and satisfied, an administrative/support fault is recorded under R18 and the decision must advance; do not create or perfect paperwork, hashes, receipts, or evidence artifacts merely to support the verdict.

**R13 — Prevent and recover malformed reports cheaply.** Add a deterministic read-only report preflight only when repeated structural handoff faults justify its cost and the inspected harness or target project actually provides it. The preflight may decide only parse/schema, declared paths, required fields, clean-tip, diff, and explicitly required outputs; it cannot decide product behavior or semantic acceptance. A producer corrects `REPORT_ONLY_ERROR` while its turn is active without changing code or rerunning product checks unless the missing product fact genuinely requires it. The orchestrator records an administrative error and advances whenever the product criteria remain decidable. Re-enter the same logical role/task only when an exact required fact is missing or ambiguous. Do not add revisions, hashes, immutable records, or separate evidence artifacts merely to make a report preflight possible.

### Review, testing, and repair

**R14 — Complete and pool before repair.** Each reviewer, test selection, observer, and deterministic
gate finishes its assigned runnable surface, except under R23 or a named failed prerequisite. A gate
records an ordinary failure, continues every remaining independent unit, and records each dependency
skip truthfully. Merge and deduplicate the complete result set once; the orchestrator triages once;
the writer repairs every compatible admitted finding once as a batch. Do not stop on the first
ordinary finding or reopen review after every edit. Apply the concrete checkpoint and batch rules in
`references/incremental-verification.md`.

**R15 — Classify every follow-up.** Route it as `production/material`, `strict test-only`, or `administrative/support`. For every test or scaffolding error, the orchestrator decides `PRODUCT_INVALIDATING`, `NONBLOCKING_TEST_ERROR`, or `INDETERMINATE`. A product repair requires a failure tied to product behavior, contract, oracle, or coverage—not merely a broken support process. A test or scaffolding error never blocks a product result when other required checks or observations still decide the behavior. After classification, activate every successor that does not consume the affected claim, capability, resource, or operation.

**R16 — Use one material route.** Compose the material route only from selected modules. When independent review and deterministic focused checks both consume the same input, launch them concurrently with disjoint result/cache roots and no shared result writer; split either path further only when its slices are independently useful. Join each selected result tranche once, batch its accepted findings once, and repeat only affected work. A selected follow-up reviewer covers the repair surface and previously violated invariants; reopen the whole surface only when a changed input affects earlier review. Do not review intermediate repair revisions. A smoke or full safeguard participates only when its module is selected.

**R17 — Use fast lanes precisely.** The existing strict test-only fast lane permits a
semantic-preserving test repair only when an accepted product requirement proves that the repaired test
still checks the same scenario and behavior with equal or stronger rigor. It may correct fixture,
mock, setup, runner, metadata, test-code, expected-literal, or test-selection mistakes, but never
production code, policy, contract, locked configuration, covered scenario, oracle, assertion strength,
expected behavior, or coverage obligation.

`FAST_LANE_V2` is a separate, optional scoped-product route. ROOT may select it only after the
originating checking tranche has completed every feasible unit under R14 and its complete pool
contains one scoped compatible material correction objective: one ROOT-confirmed observed defect
with one deterministic motivating test, a bounded production surface, a smoke consisting of
changed-source compilation plus that test, an independent frozen-tip review, and a separate
integration card. It omits the broad affected deterministic campaign, not the proof. The smoke's
compile and motivating-test PASS become checkpoint credit; after byte-identical integration, reuse
that credit when its declared inputs remain unchanged. The checkpointed gate runs only failed,
unresolved, change-affected, uncertain, or otherwise uncredited units. Do not select it for uncertain
impact, changed test/runner/configuration selection, external/hardware state, absent motivating test,
broad shared/public behavior, or a pool whose compatible findings require a broader repair batch.
Both lanes require a terminal handoff and a newly dispatched card; neither completed test/check run
may start integration. A failed or indeterminate fast-lane repeat returns to R15 classification.

**R18 — Isolate administrative and support failures.** Correct a reconstructable path, schema, report, fixture, runner, watcher, executor-environment, supervision, or cleanup fault only when an exact consumer still needs the correction and it is cheaper than recording the limitation. An administrative fault must not block a product result whose required criteria remain decidable. Mark only the exact support-dependent claim or operation unavailable and activate all other satisfied successors. If the failed support step was the only required way to decide a product criterion, block only that criterion or record `INDETERMINATE`; never infer material product repair from the support failure alone.

**R19 — Preserve passing work with conservative checkpoints.** For every expensive multi-check gate,
define the smallest economical independent check units, their source/configuration/runner/environment
and external-state inputs, prerequisites, and dependents. Checkpoint each completed unit and continue
after ordinary failures. On a changed tip, select every failed, unresolved, change-affected, or
uncertain unit; execute that set in declared order beginning with its earliest member, and do not
replay an unaffected PASS. Reuse a PASS only when its declared inputs and prerequisites are unchanged.
The checkpoint still records the first unresolved unit; when no earlier unit was invalidated, that is
the resume point. Use a repository revision or external attempt state only when it is required to
decide reuse; do not blindly hash ordinary content. A full restart is valid only without usable
progress or when a global input reaches every selected unit. For hardware/practical work, reuse a pass
only after the consumed target/resource state is verified unchanged. Run an accumulated safeguard
only to the extent remaining or invalidated units require it; its initial cold pass remains a complete
release unit when risk warrants it. Apply `references/incremental-verification.md`.

**R20 — Preflight only fragile expensive runners.** Before an expensive selection that depends on a
custom runner or child process, use one side-effect-free disposable fake to prove the inputs,
arguments, process ID/correlation, start, outputs, cleanup, exit, and—when incremental execution is
selected—its checkpoint write/read and check-unit resume boundary. Reuse the preflight while those
inputs remain unchanged. Ordinary runners need no preflight record.

### Locks, practical work, and stopping

**R21 — Identify runtime instances, not ordinary content.** Give every independently running or lifecycle-owned orchestration instance an ID: orchestrator/root processes and process trees, agent and subagent processes, provider invocations/sessions/threads, handoffs, lanes, claims/locks, and Git worktrees. Those IDs are mandatory because a multi-agent orchestrator must correlate, route, monitor, resume, stop, clean up, and retire the exact instance. Give another live resource an ID only when targeting or lifecycle control requires it. Plan-local labels such as `REQ-*`, `DEL-*`, and `CHECK-*` are optional cross-references, not runtime identities. Do not assign an ID, hash, receipt, immutable record, or evidence artifact to an ordinary feature, file, source, cache, configuration, fact, check, result, or workspace merely because it exists; a website button, for example, needs none of them by default. Require a repository revision only when an operation must target or preserve a particular repository state, a receipt only when an operation must later prove or reverse its changes, a hash only for a named byte-integrity or content-comparison decision, and immutability only for a record or history that must not change after acceptance. Rerun only direct consumers of changed inputs and continue every non-consuming edge.

**R22 — Rehearse costly external control flow.** Before scarce, irreversible, hardware, service, or other external allocation, run the exact project and control flow against disposable fakes. Check only the control properties the real attempt depends on. Reuse rehearsal while those inputs remain unchanged; never count it as a real-world pass. Name one owner for attempt state, abort/stop, observation, and cleanup. Record `not applicable` when no such resource exists.

**R23 — Stop immediately only to contain live harm.** Immediate stop requires an observed unauthorized/wrong-resource action, loss of live-process containment or cleanup, or irreversible corruption of information needed for judgment. Preserve only what diagnosis or recovery needs, contain safely, then apply R18. Pool every other observation through R14.

**R24 — Admit and end loops on product results.** Enter a product repair loop only when R12 identifies
a failed or genuinely undecidable required product criterion and one coherent repair objective can
change that outcome. A non-product fault may receive a narrow same-task continuation only when an
exact downstream operation consumes the failed capability; it never becomes a product loop. Resume
with the earliest failed, unresolved, change-affected, or uncertain action/check and preserve every
completed action and passing unit whose inputs remain unchanged. Batch compatible findings before a
writer or new assurance pass. Do not impose arbitrary iteration caps. End on success, unrecoverable
error, or stall: repeated failure signature, no passed-set growth, pass/fail oscillation, or
scope-only churn.

### Design and runtime truth

**R25 — Review proportionately.** Trivial mechanical work may omit review with a reason. Any non-trivial design review assigns at least one existing reviewer—not an automatic extra worker—to correctness, simplicity, generalizability, organization, usability, and composability. Guard verified caller mistakes and real trust boundaries; do not add speculative abstraction, hostile-input defenses outside the threat model, arbitrary limits, double guards, or paternalistic blocks on intended correctly targeted work.

**R26 — Plan only real runtime behavior.** Inspect current docs/source and distinguish runtime-enforced rules from orchestrator policy. Also distinguish the stable launcher/supervisor, the target project's own executable tooling, and document-only workflow requirements: a command available from an exact target revision may be invoked by the workflow without claiming that the stable launcher implements or automatically enforces it. Use the actual launch, wait, event, acknowledgement, isolation, result, and cleanup mechanisms available in the project; if a harness exists, inspect its real behavior rather than assuming it. State the command source, invocation owner, prerequisites, and every manual responsibility. Never name a fictional feature as automatic enforcement.

### Runtime footprint and concurrent results

**R27 — Allocate only necessary source isolation.** Give a lane a full linked worktree only when it may mutate source or its execution writes source-local state. Give each lane or Git worktree an ID because the orchestrator must own and retire the exact allocation. A static read-only lane may use the current declared source plus a separate writable result root unless a particular revision is required. A test lane uses the cheapest mode that prevents source, cache, output, and peer contamination. Do not freeze or hash a source view without a concrete need.

**R28 — Retire terminal lanes.** After semantic acceptance, remove the lane from active discovery, close its identified clean Git worktree through verified Git operations, retain only results or revisions that a named consumer still needs, and discard disposable caches. Never delete needed results, an unretained required revision, a dirty worktree, or a path used by an identified live process. Archival failure leaves the lane terminal and visible for recovery; it never reopens accepted product work.

**R29 — Serialize required shared append-only records.** When concurrent processes must write one event log, use one cross-process lock keyed to that log. A writer waits, appends one complete record, flushes, and releases the lock. Require a concurrent-process regression test. Do not create the log in the first place unless a consumer needs it, and do not invent per-controller logs or a merge layer when one lock is sufficient.

**R30 — Bound the declared executable-launcher boundary.** Every command inside the repository's
declared mechanical launcher boundary run by the orchestrator, an agent, or any nested subagent must
use the repository's existing bounded-execution architecture. The boundary is expressed as concrete
launcher categories, not semantic guesses about whether a command is a test. During
the runtime audit, discover the applicable instruction and provider configuration chain, including
`AGENTS.md`, `.codex/`, `.claude/`, or another CLI/provider-specific directory; inspect hooks,
supervisors, and task-prompt composition, and reuse the existing mechanism rather than mandating one
provider's filenames or creating a parallel runner. The effective workflow must require an exact
command, working directory, result path, heartbeat interval no greater than 60 seconds,
realistically calibrated expected upper-bound runtime, bounded cleanup allowance, computed maximum lifetime,
and basis derived from a protocol/resource constraint, accepted plan upper bound, or measured history
with stated headroom. Maximum lifetime must equal expected upper bound plus cleanup allowance. Cleanup
is capped at the smaller of 120 seconds or 25% of the upper bound, with a five-second minimum cap for
short commands, so the deadline is neither grossly padded nor shorter than the credible operation. The
supervisor must poll and
flush heartbeats independently of the caller, preserve stdout/stderr, return the command exit status,
and at deadline terminate the exact process tree, verify cleanup, and emit a terminal timeout result.
A pre-execution command hook or equivalent provider guard must reject direct calls inside the declared
launcher boundary that bypass the supervisor where the inspected runtime supports such interception;
it must not grow an unrelated catalog of test frameworks or executable languages. Every executable
agent/subagent card and prompt that may use a covered launcher must carry the policy reference and invocation
contract, even when its nested worktree does not inherit the outer instruction files. The orchestrator
must classify timeout as administrative/support pending product-impact information, preserve unaffected
green credit, and never treat timeout alone as product pass or failure. If no bounded architecture or
guard exists, represent its smallest provider-appropriate implementation as an M01 prerequisite and
mark covered execution unavailable until it is accepted.

## Structural rules for emitted plans

These rules close the gap between a correct rule list and an executable plan structure. They apply to every plan produced by this skill.

**S1 - Use a fixed envelope and composable internals.** Emit every top-level section in the exact order below. Put project-specific execution behavior only in selected module instances and their graph. Never create a different plan layout for a different project.

**S2 - Make selection explicit.** The module manifest lists every catalog module exactly once as `SELECTED`, `OMITTED`, or `DEFERRED`. `SELECTED` names all instance IDs. `OMITTED` gives a concrete reason. `DEFERRED` names the prerequisite fact and the owner who will resolve it. Do not silently omit a familiar step.

**S3 - Compose from typed dependencies.** Every selected module instance declares exact predecessor outputs and exact successor inputs. The whole-plan graph is the transitive composition of those connections. The catalog order has no execution meaning. Whenever an output satisfies a successor input, that edge is default-forward and activates without waiting for unrelated administrative/support cleanup; an exception must identify the exact consumed missing fact.

**S4 - Define global policy once.** Scheduling, review cadence, gate scope, prior-result reuse, logical-task and invocation continuity, role resolution, resources, exceptions, and acceptance live in the global policy sections. Module instances and task cards cite policy IDs; they do not copy or reinterpret the prose.

**S5 - Use mandatory language for mandatory behavior.** Write `must`, `must not`, `only when`, and `exactly when` for obligations. Use `may` only for a genuinely optional choice whose decision owner, allowed choices, and confirmation/output handling are named. Ban `as needed`, `appropriate`, `standard`, `best practice`, `if useful`, and equivalent phrases in executable instructions.

**S6 - Bound local authority.** A module instance or task card may customize its objective, scope, inputs, entrypoints, failure cases, checks, outputs, and declared exception references. It may not change a global invariant or invent a workflow step. A needed new step must be represented by a catalog module or an explicitly defined project extension module using the same schema.

ROOT must fully author those customizable values before dispatch. A worker's freedom to choose
implementation mechanics within the card is not authority to discover or redefine the task's problem,
goals, target behavior, protected surfaces, success criteria, or next graph edge.

**S7 - Define review cadence, not just review presence.** Every selected review instance declares one class: `INITIAL_IMPLEMENTATION`, `AFFECTED_REPAIR`, `MACRO_INTEGRATION`, `FINAL_PRODUCT`, or a project-defined class with a precise boundary. State what creates the reviewable frozen tip and what invalidates prior review credit. Do not treat each internal edit or commit as a review boundary.

Every review card also carries the bounded open-investigation contract from R10: ROOT fixes the input,
surface, governing requirements/invariants, watch areas, exclusions, materiality threshold, output,
and handoff, while leaving the existence and content of findings for the reviewer to determine.

**S8 - Parallelize selected independent checking paths.** Within M04 or M07, when selected review and deterministic-check paths consume the same input, put them in one parallel group, launch both before awaiting either, give them disjoint writable roots, and join them once. A serial edge is valid only when one consumes the other's output or a declared serial exception applies. Do not create a timing ledger merely to justify the parallel group.

**S9 - Pool selected repair work.** M05 triages and deduplicates the complete finding set from every
selected M04/M07/M09 checking path assigned to a gate, then returns all compatible admitted material
findings once to the same M02 logical instance and workflow role. Reuse its active invocation when
available and still selected; otherwise make the R9 structured handoff before repair. The writer
receives the whole compatible group plus relevant similar-failure seeds and returns one reviewable
repaired tip. Split only when findings require different owners, source contexts, or acceptance
decisions. Do not stop an ordinary checking path at its first finding, issue one repair per finding,
or review internal repair commits. R23 live-harm containment remains the only immediate-stop exception.

**S10 - Make full-gate scope singular and visible.** A selected M07 final-assurance instance declares
its release unit, selected audit/safeguard paths, exact dependencies, independently runnable check
units, conservative input map, checkpoint owner, and resume rule. Its executor completes every
runnable unit and returns one pool. Do not put full-suite commands in M02 repair cards. If M07 selects
no accumulated safeguard path, state why risk does not justify it. If independently released units
require separate safeguards, use one M07 instance per release unit and prove they are not duplicate
reruns.

**S11 - Select failure cases across real seams.** Before dispatching a high-coupling or high-risk producer, examine applicable categories: authority/targeting, input grammar and platform semantics, concurrency/order, lifecycle/cleanup, failure/rollback, compatibility/migration, external-resource boundaries, result truth, and public usability. Select only realistic expensive-late-failure cases; record `not applicable` categories with a short reason. Do not optimize entrypoint score by omitting a necessary seam.

**S12 - Price the graph, not just its nodes.** Estimate a range for each selected module and for the critical path. Count expensive gates, launches, external allocations, and serial joins. State the expected overlap. If observed execution exceeds the plan's upper range and another material cycle is required, the orchestrator reassesses module selection, task size, risk brief, review scope, and role allocation before another launch. This is a result-based topology reassessment, not an iteration cap.

**S13 - Compile exceptions before use.** Each exception class declares: exception ID, affected policy, trigger, decision owner, alternate action, required confirmation, preserved results, invalidated results, scope, and expiry. Local instructions may cite it but cannot broaden it. Do not use an exception to make an ordinary path vague.

**S14 - Validate cross-layer consistency.** Compare the whole-plan graph, global policies, module instances, lane manifest, task-card templates, handoff rule, and final gates. Reject any lower-layer instruction that changes an edge, serializes a required parallel group, adds a broad gate, reopens credited work, changes review cadence, expands authority, blocks a non-consuming successor, or turns a non-product fault into a product continuation without a declared exception.

Also reject any worker-facing recipe or specialized action whose verbs could transfer an unstated
semantic choice from ROOT to a worker. The plan must name the ROOT-owned decision or deterministic
decision rule and limit the worker to its execution. Review/audit may independently determine findings
only within its explicit frozen-input, surface, invariant, materiality, output, and handoff bounds.

**S15 - Separate runtime truth from workflow intent.** For each action, label enforcement as `RUNTIME_ENFORCED`, `ORCHESTRATOR_ENFORCED`, `TARGET_TOOL_INVOKED`, or `UNAVAILABLE`. Name the source, owner, prerequisites, and how it was confirmed. Never describe target work-product code as active development infrastructure merely because the workflow can execute it as a check.

**S16 - Classify and size each gate as one repairable failure family.** A gate is a decision boundary over selected module outputs or one exact operation/resource activation; a loop tranche is the connected unaccepted work that may return one complete finding pool to the same producer logical task and workflow role, with invocation reuse or structured handoff under R9. Give every gate exactly one class:

- `PRODUCT` may block only an observable behavior, contract, capability, or correctness outcome and downstream consumers of that outcome. It may enter a material loop only under R12/R24.
- `OPERATION_BOUNDARY` may block only its exact unsafe, unauthorized, unavailable, unready, or incomplete operation or resource. This class includes required allocation, integration-coordinate mutation, deployment, promotion, readback, cleanup, or retirement mechanics whenever their failure leaves the accepted product behavior intact. An operation being required by the goal does not make it a product outcome. An operation boundary never invalidates accepted product credit or enters a product repair loop; all independent work advances.

For every gate, record its class, exact blocking scope, continuation/loop eligibility, default-forward edge, and failure return or exact-block target. Do not represent an advisory/admin checkpoint as a gate. Do not size a gate or loop by file count, module count, stage labels, or an arbitrary duration/iteration cap. Assume a first pass may expose several mistakes: aggregate enough related work to discover and
repair them together, but never combine so many independent mechanisms that one failed gate becomes
several unrelated repair jobs disguised as one.

Apply this two-sided sizing method to every candidate gate or loop boundary:

1. State one gate question about one independently acceptable behavioral outcome or one exact operation boundary. Identify its class, owning authority, blocking scope, invariants/failure family, likely repair surface, acceptance method, default-forward edge, and affected-prior-result domain.
2. Pass the **aggregation test** only when grouping the work avoids meaningful repeated context loading, setup, launch, review, test, or integration cost and the grouped findings should be triaged and repaired together because they share the outcome, owner, invariants, root-cause surface, or verification.
3. Pass the **manageability test** only when the orchestrator can state one pooled repair objective, one writer/workflow role can own it, the expected findings fit one coherent source context and failure taxonomy, and a failure can invalidate affected credit without reopening unrelated accepted work. Split at the behavioral, mechanism, authority, writer, source-context, or invalidation boundary when any condition fails.
4. Merge candidates only when both tests pass. If aggregation fails, keep independent gates. If manageability fails, split even when one larger gate would save launches. When uncertain, split at the smallest independently acceptable behavior, not at an arbitrary task-size limit. Record why each retained boundary is not smaller and not larger.
5. Reassess prospectively from observed results: split an unaccepted tranche before repair when its pooled findings require independent repair objectives, owners, or change domains; merge adjacent future gates when findings repeatedly cross their boundary and they duplicate substantial setup. Preserve accepted work and never rewrite completed history merely to change the topology.

## Workflow module catalog

The catalog supplies ten macro-level construction parts. It does not define a default sequence. Read
[references/module-recipes.md](references/module-recipes.md) completely before instantiating one; that
reference fixes each selected module's internal local procedure. Select, omit, repeat, and connect the
macro-modules from project needs. Do not split an internal substep back into a top-level module.

| Type | Macro-module | Deliberately bundles | Include when | Omit when | Required output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `M01` | Prerequisite and admission closure | Missing capability, mapping, fixture, authority, or readiness check needed only to start later work | A required downstream precondition is false or undecidable | Every selected module's preconditions already hold | One prerequisite result; no product work |
| `M02` | Product implementation and repair tranche | Risk brief, singular product writing, implementation self-checks, and same-task material repair | A deliverable needs product/source/artifact changes or later accepted findings may return to its writer | The plan is decision-only | One coherent reviewable product tip plus self-check results |
| `M03` | Independent verification asset construction | Missing independent tests, fixtures, verification scripts, and required verification documentation | Acceptance needs an oracle or asset that must remain independent of M02 | Existing trusted verification assets prove every selected claim | One independently owned verification-asset tip/result |
| `M04` | Review and checking campaign | Cheap affected smoke, deterministic focused checks, independent review, optional observation, parallel launch, and one result join | A reviewable input needs one or more non-producer checks | Existing accepted results already decide the claims and proportional review is omitted with reason | One complete deduplicated result set over one shared input |
| `M05` | Adjudication, acceptance, and correction routing | Finding classification, test-impact decision, semantic verdict, pooled material return, strict test-only route, and administrative recovery | Any deliverable/release result must be decided or a finding must be routed | Nothing consumes or advances from the result | One verdict or one exact same-task correction route with preserved/invalidated credit |
| `M06` | Integration and release assembly | Ordered joins, conflict ownership, post-join affected checks, promotion, rollback when needed, and release-level retirement | Accepted revisions/artifacts must combine or advance to another coordinate | No integration or promotion boundary exists | One integrated/promoted coordinate with required rollback state |
| `M07` | Accumulated final assurance | Cross-deliverable final audit, full accumulated safeguard, parallel final checks, and release-unit acceptance handoff | Product/release risk needs assurance beyond deliverable-level results | Deliverable checks already decide the complete goal and omission is justified | One final result pool over one named release unit |
| `M08` | Expensive or external readiness check | Fragile-runner preflight and disposable external-control rehearsal | An expensive custom executor or scarce/irreversible external operation has an unproven control path | Runner/control path is ordinary or already checked under unchanged relevant inputs | One readiness result that is not a product pass |
| `M09` | Practical or external validation | Authorization, retained attempt state, real execution, independent observation, stop/abort, checkpoint/resume, result join, and cleanup | Acceptance requires a real environment, service, deployment, provider, hardware, or long-lived practical result | Static/synthetic checks satisfy the goal | One contained real-attempt result with required observation and cleanup |
| `M10` | Project extension | Only behavior no composition of M01-M09 can express | A required capability is genuinely absent from the catalog | Existing macro-modules and policies cover it | One standard-schema module with a named expressive gap and no duplicate policy |

## Exact module-instance schema

Render every selected instance under Section 11 using the exact 16-heading block in
`references/execution-plan-template.md`. Fill every heading in order, including gate/loop references,
complete-pool return, affected prior results, isolation, and critical-path effect. Do not add a custom
instance shape; use M10 only when a genuinely missing module behavior requires extension.

## Exact local-instruction schema

Use the exact 20-field task-card table in `references/execution-plan-template.md` for every executable
producer, reviewer, check, observer, repair, or external instance. If the runtime has a stricter
accepted schema, map all 20 semantic fields to it explicitly. Local instructions may customize only
the authorized task content; they may not change role, required runtime-object correlation, completion ownership, failure/thread
rules, global policy citations, or graph edges. A handoff records facts and the next authorized edge.

Treat the 20 fields as one ROOT-authored dispatch contract, not as independent boxes that a worker
must interpret into a task. For non-review work, the fields collectively must define the problem,
desired result, exact behaviors/claims, required and forbidden change boundaries, targets, protected
behavior, checks, acceptance, pitfalls, and escalation route. For review/audit work, they must define
the bounded investigation and its materiality/output contract without prescribing findings. A bare
`N/A`, `TBD`, `TODO`, `UNKNOWN`, or appeal to worker judgment in any material field makes the card
undispatchable; use a reasoned N/A only where the selected recipe explicitly permits it.

## Build the plan step by step

Perform these passes in order. Finish each named output before starting the next pass; later passes may
send a specific unresolved fact back to its owning pass, but may not silently rewrite earlier decisions.
This procedure authors a plan. It never executes the resulting workflow. For every pass, instantiate
all five local fields in `references/compiler-pass-recipes.md`: `Inputs`, `Ordered actions`, `Decision
table`, `Emit`, and `Complete only when`. The prose below is the high-level route; the referenced local
recipe is normative and no field may be inferred, skipped, or replaced with free-form judgment.

### Pass 1 - Freeze the request and destinations

- **Read:** direct user instructions, goal/spec, acceptance material, requested output path, project
  root, runtime root, resource limits, and the canonical role-model mapping if it exists.
- **Decide:** which documents are operative, which are reference-only, what is explicitly excluded,
  and whether the task authorizes creation of a missing mapping.
- **Write:** the source register and output coordinates in working notes. Do not draft workflow prose.
- **Stop when:** a missing input would change scope, authority, or provider allocation; ask one
  consolidated question. Do not stop for facts discoverable from the named project.

### Pass 2 - Build the authority and contradiction register

- Follow the authority audit in `references/project-truth-audit.md`. Record each source's path or
  reference, what it governs, and the conflict rule. Add a revision or hash only if R21 identifies a
  concrete operation that needs one; the source table has no identity column.
- Compare goal, acceptance, repository instructions, existing plan, and runtime documentation. Record
  each contradiction as a decision item; never blend incompatible directives into vague prose.
- Produce the complete Section 1 authority rows and Section 14 unresolved rows before decomposition.

### Pass 3 - Normalize outcomes and atomic coverage

- Turn the required product behavior into plan-local `OUT-*` outcomes and `REQ-*` requirements when
  cross-references need labels. Split only when two clauses can independently pass, fail, be owned, or
  require different verification.
- Bind every requirement to one observable acceptance claim and one decision owner. Preserve exact
  source citations; record exclusions and authorization boundaries separately from requirements.
- Check that satisfying all requirement rows would satisfy the goal without relying on implied work.
  The output is Sections 2 and 3, not an execution sequence.

### Pass 4 - Audit repository and runtime truth

- Inspect relevant Git state/cleanliness, source seams, available checks, launch/wait/result behavior,
  isolation, locks, lifecycle, and external capabilities. Prefer source and executable help over prose.
- Classify each needed action as `RUNTIME_ENFORCED`, `ORCHESTRATOR_ENFORCED`,
  `TARGET_TOOL_INVOKED`, or `UNAVAILABLE`; name its source, invocation owner, prerequisite, confirmation,
  and fallback. Never turn desired behavior into a claimed runtime feature.
- Produce Section 4 and the raw facts needed by Sections 7, 10, and 12. A missing required capability
  becomes a prerequisite candidate; an unavailable optional convenience is not invented.

### Pass 5 - Form coherent deliverables

- Group requirements by independently useful behavioral output, dependency order, shared invariant,
  integration seam, and acceptance method. Ignore equal-size aesthetics and file counts.
- For each `DEL-*`, state inputs, outputs, requirements, dependencies, shared seams, release unit, and
  why separating or combining it would improve or hurt correctness, context, or wall time.
- Keep two units separate when either can be accepted and used without the other or when they require
  different authorities/writers/change domains. Merge them when partial acceptance is meaningless
  and the same owner must reason across their shared behavior.

### Pass 6 - Model risk, failure cases, and cost

- For every deliverable, list only realistic late-expensive failures, their impact/coupling, earliest
  decisive oracle, context demand, expensive operations, and expected duration range.
- Apply S11 to decide which failure cases belong in the producer's existing card. Reject generic
  hardening, cosmetic concerns, and duplicated checks. Record why each selected case is worth its cost.
- Produce both Section 5 tables. Use the risk/cost rows as the reason for every later non-minimal
  module, fan-out, serial edge, gate, rehearsal, and safeguard.

### Pass 7 - Select workflow modules

- Start with the smallest topology that can produce and semantically accept each deliverable. Evaluate
  M01-M10 individually against its include and omit conditions; do not trace a remembered workflow.
- Mark every catalog row `SELECTED`, `OMITTED`, or `DEFERRED`. A selected module receives one or more
  plan-local `MI-*` references and a named payoff. A deferred module names the missing fact and owner.
- Recheck coverage: module omission may remove ceremony, never a requirement, decision owner, or needed
  verification path. The result is the complete Section 6 manifest.

### Pass 8 - Define roles and bind the sole mapping

- Derive workflow roles from selected module responsibilities. Set pool one by default; increase it
  only for named independent slices with measurable time, isolation, or coverage benefit.
- Put role semantics, authority, resources, activation, and lifetime in Section 7. Put concrete
  provider/model/effort/tier selection only in the canonical mapping. Every executable role appears
  exactly once there, and changing the mapping must not require a plan edit.
- If the runtime cannot resolve roles at launch, select M01 for that prerequisite instead of copying
  provider values into cards or commands.
- Define every non-ROOT role as an executor, reviewer, checker, or observer within a ROOT-authored
  contract. Do not assign task-definition, scope-definition, success-definition, acceptance, or
  self-dispatch authority to a worker role. Preserve the bounded review/audit discovery exception
  without giving the reviewer authority to expand its assigned surface or prescribe the next edge.

### Pass 9 - Instantiate each selected module

- Fill one Section 11 block per `MI-*` using the exact module-instance schema. Convert its catalog
  invariant and global rules into project-specific preconditions, inputs, ordered actions, outputs,
  results, failure routes, prior-result boundaries, and cost effect.
- Fill all 20 local task-card fields for each executable instance. Copy every recipe action reference
  in order, specializing its text or recording only recipe-authorized N/A. Give exact initial entrypoints
  and enough shared-seam context to perform the task without reconstructing project history.
- Keep authority local: an instance may narrow its own work but may not add a global gate, role,
  exception, resource, review cadence, or rerun rule.
- Before an executable instance is dispatchable, compile all 20 fields into the complete R6/R10
  ROOT-authored contract. Verify that a worker can begin at the named entrypoints, execute the desired
  result, preserve named non-goals, recognize task-specific pitfalls, run or return the required proof,
  and stop/escalate correctly without inventing task meaning or reconstructing history. For review or
  audit, verify instead that the investigation is concretely bounded while its findings remain open.

### Pass 10 - Compose the typed execution graph

- Connect an instance only when its declared output satisfies another instance's declared input.
  Draw the actual serial spine, conditional branches, fan-outs, parallel groups, joins, repair returns,
  external authorization boundaries, and terminals; catalog order supplies no edge.
- Give every edge a condition and failure branch. Give every real fan-out one join or prove its outputs
  are independently terminal. Do not draw a split for a singleton or serialize independent checks
  merely because one path was written first.
- Mark every satisfied successor as default-forward. A failed support/admin/readiness fact may remove only edges that consume it; preserve and activate all other ready edges at the earliest failed, unresolved, change-affected, or uncertain action/check while retaining unaffected credit.
- Produce the edge and parallel-group tables in Section 8, then reflect the same topology in Sections
  10 and 11. Any disagreement is a compiler error.

### Pass 11 - Size gates and repair loops

- Apply S16's gate classification, aggregation, and manageability tests to every proposed gate. State class, one behavioral/operation question, shared input, checking instances, shared failure family, exact blocking scope, continuation/loop eligibility, default-forward edge, return/block target, prior-result boundary, aggregation payoff, and split/merge trigger.
- Classify by what a failure disproves, not by whether the step is required. If accepted behavior remains true and only an allocation, join, deployment, promotion, readback, cleanup, retirement, or other coordinate mutation is incomplete, emit `OPERATION_BOUNDARY`; never disguise the required operation as a product gate.
- Assume a first pass may find several related defects. Make the tranche large enough to pool them,
  but split whenever one return would require independent repair objectives, writers, source contexts,
  authorities, or invalidation decisions.
- Apply S8 within retained M04/M07 gates: selected independent review and deterministic-check paths over
  the same shared input run in one parallel group. Apply S9: M05 returns the complete admitted material
  pool once to the same M02 logical task and workflow role, reusing or handing off its invocation under
  R9. Compile the selected gate's check-unit checkpoint and conservative input map, including the
  remaining-unit route after ordinary failures and the earliest failed, unresolved, change-affected,
  or uncertain resume unit. Neither rule adds a macro-module that Pass 7 omitted.

### Pass 12 - Compile global policy and exceptions

- Fill P01-P15 once from R1-R30 and S1-S16. For every policy name its owner, trigger, mandatory action,
  exit, optional result/record location when a consumer needs one, and applicable module IDs.
- Define an exception only for a concrete alternate route. Give it an ID, affected policy, exact trigger,
  decision owner, allowed action, required confirmation, preserved/invalidated results, scope, and expiry.
- Compile R12/R14/R15/R17/R18/R19/R21/R24 into P04/P07/P08/P09/P10/P11/P13 so decided product work
  advances immediately, non-product faults block only exact consumers, every ordinary gate failure
  returns a complete runnable finding pool, compatible repairs batch, and continuation resumes from
  the earliest failed/unresolved/change-affected/uncertain unit with unaffected credit preserved.
- When the plan selects an expensive multi-check gate, an accumulated safeguard, stateful
  practical/hardware validation, or `FAST_LANE_V2`, put the literal `CHECKPOINTED_VERIFICATION_V1`
  in Section 0. It selects this verification protocol for structural validation; it is not a runtime
  identity, hash, or required record.
- Compile R30 into P02/P04/P09: every orchestrator, agent, and nested-subagent test card/prompt adopts
  the discovered bounded-test policy; the runtime supervisor owns heartbeat/deadline/cleanup; an
  available provider hook blocks recognized bypasses; expected upper bound plus capped cleanup
  computes the deadline; and timeout returns to support classification.
- Reject any local phrase such as `as needed` that hides an undeclared decision. Unknown exceptions
  require a plan amendment or `INCOMPLETE`, not runtime improvisation; ordinary classification through
  the compiled failure routes is not an exception.
- Compile the ROOT-authored dispatch contract into P01 and P02. P01 must make ROOT the owner of the
  concrete problem, desired result, required behavior/proof, target and protected boundaries, repair
  classification, pitfalls, acceptance criteria, and next-edge decision. P02 must require workers to
  execute within that contract, return insufficiency or contradictions, terminate at each ROOT
  decision boundary, and continue only through a separately issued card.

### Pass 13 - Compile lanes, resources, checks, results, and lifecycle

- Derive Section 10 from the graph: create rows only for real lanes, claims/locks, named checks,
  required durable results, every handoff, source allocations, and retirement actions. Use reasoned
  N/A rows where machinery is unnecessary. IDs are mandatory for the runtime instances named by R21;
  never create an ID or artifact for ordinary content merely to fill a category.
- Give concurrent writers disjoint roots or one correct shared append lock. Give mutating work the
  cheapest safe source isolation. Correlate every process, agent/subagent invocation, handoff, lane,
  claim/lock, and Git worktree with its mandatory runtime ID; do not impose IDs on ordinary content.
- State activation, completion, failure, cleanup, recovery visibility, and affected prior results.
  Terminal cleanup never erases a revision or result that a named consumer still needs.

### Pass 14 - Compile external, integration, and terminal behavior

- In Section 12, instantiate only selected practical/external modules. Separate disposable rehearsal
  claims from real-world acceptance, state exact authorization, and name the controller and cleanup owner.
- In Section 13, instantiate only selected integration, safeguard, audit, promotion, rollback, and
  retirement modules. Name accepted inputs, order, affected checks, release unit, and rollback state when needed.
- Resolve every semantic selection before dispatch: ROOT chooses the admitted integration inputs and
  order, conflict route, audit/safeguard profile, real-attempt authorization, retry/new-attempt route,
  and acceptance boundary. An executor may apply only the named mechanical comparison, branch, or
  operation and must return any undeclared choice or conflict to ROOT.
- Do not manufacture a universal final phase. An omitted module remains visibly omitted in Section 6
  and receives only the required reasoned N/A treatment in the fixed structural section.

### Pass 15 - Price and simplify the completed graph

- Compute module ranges, overlap, launches, expensive gates, external allocations, serial joins, and
  the critical path. Compare the result with the cheapest adequate topology named in Section 5.
- Remove every node, edge, repeated read, rerun, artifact, isolation boundary, or fan-out whose named
  benefit does not plausibly exceed startup, context, coordination, merge, and maintenance cost.
- Remove any wait, continuation, or repair edge whose only purpose is to perfect a non-product artifact after the required product result is independently decidable; retain only the exact dependent operation block or claim-level incompleteness.
- Re-run coverage and safety checks after removal. Simplicity may remove machinery, never required
  behavior, necessary verification, live-harm containment, or semantic acceptance.

### Pass 16 - Fill, cross-check, and validate the final document

- Fill `references/execution-plan-template.md` from Section 0 through Section 16 in order. Replace every
  template token, delete all template notes, and use exact headings, tables, policy names, and schemas.
- Populate Section 15 only after the plan behavior exists; a rule citation cannot substitute for an
  implementation. Run every Section 16 semantic check and record a one-line basis.
- Run the packaged validator with the plan and mapping paths. Fix all failures, reread affected sections,
  and rerun until both manual semantic validation and deterministic structural validation pass.
- During manual V10/V13/V14/V27 validation, inspect the substance of every worker card, not merely the
  presence of its fields. Reject a card that delegates discovery of its task semantics to the worker;
  reject a review card that lacks a concrete investigation boundary or improperly dictates findings.
- Audit every specialized recipe verb under the ROOT-authority interpretation above. Confirm that
  test authors materialize ROOT-supplied behavior and proof goals, integration executors stop for
  conflict decisions, assurance executors run ROOT-selected paths, and practical workers never start
  a new attempt without a separate ROOT decision and card.

## Fill the exact template

Use `references/execution-plan-template.md` as a schema, not as prose to paste unchanged. Preserve its
title pattern, Sections 0-16, exact table headers, P01-P15 order, module-instance headings, local-card
fields, and structural-check IDs. Replace every `{{TOKEN}}` with project-specific content and remove
every `TEMPLATE NOTE`. Use one reasoned `N/A` row only where the template permits inapplicability.

Write each section from its upstream compiler output: authority before coverage, coverage before
deliverables, deliverables before module selection, instances before graph verification, and the rule
matrix and validation result last. This is an authoring dependency, not a mandatory runtime sequence.
Never edit the packaged template to make one plan validate; fix the plan or, when the compiler contract
itself is intentionally changed, update the skill, template, validator, and self-tests together.

## Validate the plan

1. Perform the template's semantic checks manually against the goal, sources, and selected graph.
   Record an honest `PASS` or `FAIL` basis in Section 16; this does not require a durable evidence artifact.
2. Run the validator from the project root:

```powershell
python .codex/skills/design-project-topology/scripts/validate_execution_plan.py <plan-path> --mapping <mapping-path>
```

3. Fix every reported structural or cross-reference error, then rerun both affected semantic checks
   and the script. Do not weaken the validator, insert dummy rows, or mark a failure N/A to gain a pass.
4. Finish only when the script prints `execution plan validation: PASS`, every Section 16 row is `PASS`,
   and the document ends with `PLAN_STRUCTURE=VALID`.

## Deliver

Write the plan to the requested path and create the sole mapping only when the project does not
already have one. Report the plan path, mapping path, input sources, selected/omitted/deferred module
summary, role set, critical path, non-minimal complexity decisions, unresolved inputs, and validation
result. Do not repeat concrete model assignments, do not execute the plan, and do not create runtime
state.
