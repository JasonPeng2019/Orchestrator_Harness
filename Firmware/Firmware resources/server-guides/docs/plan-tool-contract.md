# Current plan-tool contract

This reference is derived from `guardrails/plan_defs.py`, the runtime source of truth.
The live MCP schemas remain authoritative if this reference drifts.

Every plan tool is first called with its complete NULL envelope. A populated call accepts
only the plan JSON object, binds the exact action parameters below, and rejects extra fields.

- Purpose: Create or repair one logical board profile and its safety evidence.
- Budget mode: `fixed`
