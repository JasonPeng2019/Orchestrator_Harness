# Coordination and recovery

Read this reference only when the plan uses delegated investigation, review,
multiple writers, staged integration, live/external operations, or a nontrivial
recovery path. It describes the facts a useful plan must carry; it does not require
an additional coordination artifact.

Direct dispatch from the global delivery owner is the default. A bounded lane lead
may dispatch workers only when the plan establishes a stable lane outcome, clear
local authority, real internal coordination work, and one terminal result for the
global owner. The global owner retains scope, shared-resource, cross-lane,
integration, live-operation, and final-acceptance decisions. A lane lead cannot
create another orchestration layer.

## Decide whether delegation helps

Use a helper only when its result changes a concrete decision or safely shortens the
critical path. Good reasons include:

- a bounded unfamiliar subsystem must be mapped before design;
- a specialist must evaluate a security, data, performance, accessibility, or
  operational risk;
- an independent check is warranted for a consequential behavior; or
- genuinely separate implementation outcomes can proceed concurrently.

Do not delegate because agents are available, to fill a role list, to generate
approval records, or to review work already decided by stronger evidence. A single
owner remains preferable when coordination and reconciliation would cost more than
the independent work.

## Scope a useful assignment

A delegated assignment should make these facts sufficiently clear for the worker
and the consuming decision:

- the question or completed outcome;
- why it is needed now and which decision consumes it;
- relevant context and initial entrypoints;
- in-scope and protected/out-of-scope surfaces;
- write authority and owned paths, if any;
- accepted inputs and dependencies;
- checks the worker should run or evidence it should inspect;
- expected return and completion condition; and
- the condition that should come back to the delivery owner instead of being
  guessed through.

Express those facts in the natural task description; do not force a fixed
20-field card or repeat context already supplied by the runtime. The worker’s
return normally needs only the result or findings, changed paths when it wrote,
checks actually run and their outcomes, and unresolved blockers or integration
notes. Do not require hashes, copied logs, evidence bundles, or acceptance forms
unless a specific downstream consumer needs them.

### Read-only support

A read-only investigator or reviewer receives a bounded question and enough project
context to answer it. Its response needs only enough substance for the delivery
owner to locate a material issue and understand what decision or requirement it can
affect. Cite a path or behavior when useful and recommend a change only when one is
warranted. “No material issue found” is a valid result. Missing presentation detail
does not justify a rerun when the consuming decision is already clear.

The delivery owner applies the skill's requirement-fit classification. Reviewer
confidence, severity wording, or agreement does not create acceptance authority or
expand what the finding can actually invalidate.

## Plan parallel writers only across stable boundaries

Before authorizing concurrent writes, establish:

- each lane’s completed outcome;
- a disjoint path, component, or artifact boundary;
- shared interfaces or assumptions that are already stable;
- inputs supplied by earlier work;
- local checks that do not mutate another lane’s state;
- the integration order and integration owner; and
- the route for a conflict or newly shared decision.

Put plan-wide lane grouping and shared boundaries in `PLAN.md`; put only local
inputs and write ownership in the relevant step file. Do not add a second ownership
table or lane registry containing the same facts.

Parallel writers are not independent when they both change the same interface,
migration, generated output, dependency lockfile, global configuration, or release
decision. Put that shared change under one owner before fan-out, serialize the
writers, or redraw the lanes.

Use worktrees or isolated writable roots only when concurrent changes or tools can
interfere. Isolation is not a substitute for clear ownership. The integration owner
reviews and tests the combined bytes; worker summaries do not prove integration.

## Use gates only for real decisions

A gate should answer one consequential question, such as:

- Is a required behavior established by sufficient evidence?
- Is the shared contract stable enough for consumers to start?
- Is a migration or external action authorized and recoverable?
- Is the integrated result safe to roll out?

Name what consumes the answer and what a failure blocks. An informational milestone,
report publication, reviewer sign-off, or format check is not a gate unless a binding
external process actually consumes it.

Prefer the cheapest decisive check. Combine compatible findings before returning
them to a writer. Do not stop at the first ordinary failure when other independent
checks can finish cheaply, and do not force every downstream lane to wait on an
unrelated failed administrative task.

## Coordinate external, stateful, or destructive work

For an operation against live services, hardware, user data, production state, or
another scarce resource, include only the controls the operation needs:

- exact authority and target;
- prerequisites and a safe readiness check;
- one owner for the operation and resource state;
- observable success and failure signals;
- stop/abort conditions;
- retry or idempotency behavior;
- rollback or containment when possible; and
- cleanup and readback.

Use a disposable rehearsal when it materially reduces the chance of live harm and
can exercise the relevant control path. A rehearsal is not proof that the live
outcome succeeded. Do not build a generic harness or simulation framework for a
single ordinary command.

## Preserve progress through failures

Apply the skill's
[requirement-fit classification](../SKILL.md#validate-requirement-fit-not-literal-perfection)
before changing execution state. Then map the affected fact to its direct consumers.

Track dependencies rather than ceremony. A changed input invalidates direct
consumers and their downstream conclusions, not unrelated results. A corrected
report does not rerun implementation or tests. A repaired local component reruns
its focused checks and only the integration checks whose inputs changed.

### Worker or handoff problems

If useful work exists but a worker return is incomplete:

1. Recover the result from available artifacts or ask for the exact missing fact.
2. Keep valid implementation and check results.
3. Resume the same worker only when the runtime supports it and continuity is
   useful; otherwise give a fresh worker the retained state and first unresolved
   action.
4. Do not ask the worker to repeat discovery, implementation, or tests whose inputs
   have not changed.

There is no mandatory retry count. Continue while each attempt produces meaningful
progress and the expected value exceeds its cost. Stop repeating the same approach
when the failure signature or lack of progress shows that a prerequisite,
assignment, tool, or assumption must change.

Resolved errors, new relevant evidence, completed actions, and eliminated
hypotheses are progress; elapsed time, silence, or transcript length alone do not
show failure. A replacement must change the failed prerequisite, task boundary,
or next action. Diagnose the native launch error and relevant configuration or
credential context before retrying; distinguish authentication from permission.
If a process handle is lost, reconcile its identity, checkpoint, and effects
before relaunching or replaying a side-effecting action.

### Review and repair loops

Pool compatible findings and make one coherent repair. Re-review the changed surface
and any invalidated invariant, not the entire project by default. A new finding may
expand the affected scope only through a demonstrated dependency.

For a parallel, staged, or expensive plan, sanity-check the approximate critical
path and actual resource limits. Each important serial edge should have a real
dependency, authority boundary, shared resource, or unresolved isolation reason.
Name the event that would justify rescheduling; do not maintain a timing ledger or
promise a duration.

When a loop stops making progress:

- preserve the last accepted baseline and still-valid checks;
- state the unresolved behavior or evidence;
- diagnose the repeated cause;
- change the approach, boundary, owner, prerequisite, or oracle;
- plan only the remaining work; and
- continue independent work that does not consume the blocker.

Do not reset history, replace reviewers to obtain a preferred verdict, relabel
failure as success, or restart from zero to make records look clean.

## Integrate and finish

The delivery owner:

1. inspects actual changes for write-boundary overlap or contract impact, correcting
   harmless deviations locally instead of rejecting an otherwise valid lane;
2. resolves shared-contract or merge conflicts serially;
3. integrates in the declared dependency order;
4. runs focused checks after each risky join when useful;
5. runs the planned combined verification on the actual integrated result;
6. states unresolved material product risks honestly; and
7. retires temporary resources without deleting dirty or still-needed work.

Completion is based on the requested behavior and sufficient required evidence,
not universal process perfection. A concise summary of the integrated outcome,
observed checks, and remaining material risks is enough unless the user or an
existing project process asks for more.
